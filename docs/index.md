Common Cents is a **money-tracking application** to help students to organise their expenses **operating small businesses**. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). <br>  
  
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[our Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-t13-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* If you are interested in using Common Cents, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**]((UserGuide.html#quick-start)).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
