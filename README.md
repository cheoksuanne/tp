* Common Cents is a **money-tracking app** to help students to organise their expenses **operating small businesses**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as an expense and savings tracker
  * to categorise various types of expenses
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[our Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-t13-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
